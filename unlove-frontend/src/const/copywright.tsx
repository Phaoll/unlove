        "EN": `As we witnessed relationships waxe and wane, we understood that deep commitment is correlated with a limited number of core values.
        
        We divided these values in 6 categories: family, work, loyalty, personal pastime, future design, and general values. To assess them correctly we ask both partner to answer 30 questions on a special scale from 1 to 5 and we measure the arithmetical distance between the two partners.

        - The scale is not numeric. You are asked to rank each sentence between Dealbreaker, Inconvenience, Indifference, Quality, Necessity. 
        - A Dealbreaker is a value on which it is nearly impossible for you to compromise, finding it in a partner would destroy nearly any possibility to create a long term relationship with your partner. Dealbreakers can be children, drugs, open relationships.
        - An Inconvenience is a value that you wouldn't like to find in a partner, it wouldn't break the whole relationship appart and you can compromise on it. Inconveniences can be a relation with a work or pastime.
        - An Indifference is a value you don't care about in your partner. Neutrals can be their taste in food.
        - A Quality is a value which would bring interest to your partner if they have it, it is not enough in itself to make them The One but it is a great start. Quality can be a certain level of empathy, attention, independence.
        - A Necessity is a value that you need to find in your partner, if they don't have it, it is hard for you to envision a life with them. Necessities can be children (again), a taste for trips, religion.`
